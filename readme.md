# React Simple

Just like the good old jQuery days. Get up and running in a flash with React. No build tools, no config, no bullshit. Also no server side rendering, routes or any other tools you may need down the road. This is aimed and getting yourself up and running with the least amount of over head.

# Installation

Run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from your terminal in the project directory, open up `localhost:8000` then edit `script.js` to your hearts content.

# Notes

- There are two globals available in `script.js`, `React` and `ReactDOM`.
- If you can't get the python server running after shutting it down run `killall python`.
